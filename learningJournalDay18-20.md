  The more simple you can keep your CSS, the better it is; and remember to Control Flow.**

***Week 4***
Code 201: Day 1 (DAY 16)
  **About project**
- We all help an learn to manage our stress.
- AGAIN, It's vey easy to look at someone else code, and see what is broke; but it's very difficult to see what's wrong with your code: because we, as developers, see what we want to get out of our code vs. what the user sees and experience: WE WANT TO PUT OURSELVES, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, IN THE USERS'S SHOES.

**MY FIRST PART IN OUR GROUP PROJECT**
  - User Stories (I FOOLWED THESE STEPS, AND WE WENT AWAY FROM IT BUT GOT BACK ON TRACK)
    *1. Write your own user stories:
      a. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role (DO THIS STEP FIRST)
        i. In a file called user_stories.md
        ii. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process
        iii. Next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.
      b. Consider the multiple roles involved:
        i. The marketing research team
        ii. The developer
        iii. The focus group participant (who will be using the application)
    2. Take about 30-45 minutes to work on the user stories (A wise student would)
    3. Draft a technical plan for the project:
      a. A detailed to-do list of things to make, step by step and tested at each stage, before getting into the code
      b. That time spent in thought and planning will make the code flow a lot faster
      c. Give yourself a series of little problems to solve (rather an a ginormous thing that you just wade through and poke at):*
        i. Set 'em up, and knock 'em down
      **ii. Plan your work, and work your plan**

  - Goals to complete by the start of class Tuesday morning:
    **Note: There's a lot of moving pieces in this assignment, and more details to attend to than it might seem at first. Build methodically, in small pieces, that you test and check regularly. ACP regularly on at least one non-master branch. Try sketching out a plan on paper and breaking down the problem conceptually before getting into the code.**
    1. Create a new repo for this weekly project called bus-mall at the root level of your ~/CF/201 directory.
    2. Scaffold your repo with:
      a. The usual README
      b. CSS
      c. JS
      d. HTML files
      e. Plus a img/ directory.
    3. Retrieve the assets from the assets/ directory in the week-03 directory of our class repo and place them in your image directory.
   *4. Write your user stories as described above and place them in a file called user-stories.md in your repo. Utilize good Markdown style to make this document look nice.*
    5. The thing you want to build today will select three random photos from the image directory and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
    6. In addition, you'll want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. You'll also want to track how many times each image is displayed, for statistical purposes.
    7. Upon receiving a click, three new non-duplicating random images need to be automatically displayed. In other words, the three images that are displayed should contain no duplicates, nor should they duplicate with any images that we displayed immediately before.
    8. To do this, you'll want a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image, and has (at a minimum) properties for the name of the image (to be used for display purposes), its file path, the number of times it has been shown, and the number of times it has been clicked. You'll probably find it useful to create a property that contains a text string you can use as an ID in HTML.
    9. After 25 selections have been made, turn off the event listeners on the images (to prevent additional voting) and also display a list of the products with votes received with each list item looking like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer".
  **10. Remember to submit a link to your most recent PR following the instructions in Canvas.**
**I also worked on the JS**
- Started with a good, but long approach
- I even like Rachael's code, more.
  *Code 201: Day 1 (DAY 17)*
  I was moved to the CSS side of things
  - found vids, background, imgs, etc.
  - I helped funnel the problems into a solution.
  - I was able to show the group we changed our plan; but that's okay: Isaiah helped me with this.
  - Isaiah and I are working together on my communication skills.
  - The group likes to hang out with each other, now.
  ***I FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE OUR BACKGROUND AND CSS WORK; AND THE GROUP LIKES MY APPROACH; BUT NEED TO FIX SOME LOGIC***
