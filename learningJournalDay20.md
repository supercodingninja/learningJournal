  The more simple you can keep your CSS, the better it is; and remember to Control Flow.**

***Week 4***
Code 201: Day 5 (DAY 20)
There were some issues brought to my attention, today.  I am an adult; therefore, I will address them.  When you can actually here and see people speaking about you, you're faced with the challenge of how you will react to the situation.  I am an adult; therefore, I will faced All issues of concern; and move on.  I've already addressed most of them, in so, much, I was constantly invited by different people to hang out.  I rather take the moment to breathe.  There are changes that I must make- first going with my gut and original decisions: I was more focused on finances, I could not place enough attention to my studies: I should of went nights; but the VA rep wanted me in days.  I actually like the days (train, can go to church); but there was not enough money.  If someone does read this, maybe they can say a word to the Dean and Dr. Hamm- this is the only reason I actually failed: money is a driver, because my family is first.  It does not matter to me if I'm not the only one- that does not change the fact that I need to feed my family.  A lot went wrong, some people lied to me; and I made it happen.  No matter what anyone can say about me, I learn something; and I will move forward with that knowledge; and I hope to make Dr. Hamm and my Dean proud (I want to say they are new real friends, and I will treat them as such: I hope I am right about them).  Today was rough at the start; but more so, at the finish; but I stayed until the very end; and made it happen.  May my GOD, my family; and the human race remember me as such: it's been a thrilling ride, thus far; but I'm not giving up: I'm looking forward to a happy ending, and smoother ride, towards my end (whenever that day is); and may it be a great day.  As a Minister, Father, Coder, Person, I have a responsibility to change my world; and I hope to do that, one line at a time- to victory: I make a toast unto myself- I deserve it, I finished; and no can take that away from me, nor the knowledge that I obtain (even if under 90%, I still learn 80% +/- of the material, which means, there's hope).  Whether I finish with Code Fellows or not, I WILL FINISH.  I am looking forward to taking Code 201, Code 301; and all of the Code 401 classes offered.  May GOD be with me; and may I always give Him the thanks that He more than truly deserves.
