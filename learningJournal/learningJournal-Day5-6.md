What I learned by the end of Week 1; and rolling into week two:

Code Day 5:
***Pow WoW!!!***
- you have to specialize in the role that you want to be in. You need to put in additional effort that you want to be in.  An interview is all about perspective: it's how the other person see who you are.  If they can't tell how good of a person, of who you are, it's your fault: you didn't show them.  Use perspective to your advantage.  The end goal is the singular goal: you want to go to that interview; and get them to say, "Yes."  I am imagine of things I would want to talk about; and so, in my case, I worked that interview backwards [30' ft view].  No one really agrees on how a resume should look like; so, how is your resume suppose to look like: you write your resume to get people to want to talk to you.  Try to address people's bias that they may have of you, ahead of time.  An interview needs to be a conversation: ask them about the team- you have to address these balances (their/your own biases, and showing them you care about the team).  It's hard to remember facts; but it's easier to remember stories.  Try to target your stories to things they care about.  It's your responsibility to drive the conversation, be specific in the story.  Learn how to white board, learn how to narearate, and learn how to ask them questions: interviewers are trying to see if you're the person they're looking for.  write tests on the white board: they'll see that you're the person that runs tests.  Make sure that you're learning.  If you feel like you messed up, go back and try to rebuild: because that's your one shot.  Write resumes.  Build apps, even if they suck: they want to see people that get things done.  You want to get to a "Yes" as quickly as possible with the resume.  Test your stuff in production: if you don't get an answer, you may just need to rewrite your resume.
  -how do you cram 4years into 4 months:
      - look at cs programs and learn the topics they go over it.
      -education is great; but experiences sates how you apply what you know.  Build real websites, and how did you face them; and even if you mess up, write down what you learn from them.  Have a laundry lists of completed projects.  You be surprise, people just want people to solve their problems.  Everyone is just building something that solves real life problems.  Go to meet ups; and get referrals.  You got address the biases.  Show them commonalities.  Don't let age stop you.

***study touch***
- touch creates files (i.e. index.html, style.css, app.js)


***Week 2***
Code 201: Day 1 (DAY 6)
  **Have the <script> test.js before app.js in your HTML: because test.js will always try to run before app.js; and it will create errors if you do not run before.**
  - your code style should ALWAYS be readable.
  - your code style should inflect the style of the team.
  -when you want put a conjuction or any character that you want JavaScript to ignore, just put a \ before the character.

  **Test Driven Development (TDD)** is very important: write the code that you first want o pass; and then the behavior that you want to pass.

  **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)**

  There is no absolute truth to coding- it'shere is no absolute truth to coding is like finding out Santa Clause isn't real. like finding out Santa Clause isn't real.

  **Article of Domain**
    - Understanding the Problem Domain is The Hardest Part of Programming.

  **Functions, Objects, and Methods**
  *Example*
  var Maddie = {
    nickname: 'Maddie',
    givenName: 'Madeline',
    personality: ['fun', 'helpful', 'awesome',],
    greeting: function() {
      console.log('Hi, my name is ' + this givenName + ' but you can call me Maddy.')
      }
  }

  **The Document Object Model**
- When we talk about Domain Modeling, we talk about the attributes of domain modeling; then, the behavior, etc.
- Ch. 5 in JS book.
*Example*


**Learn to implement Math.Randoms Numbers**
- it will return a zero; but never a return a 1. ref. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random "Return value a floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)."
