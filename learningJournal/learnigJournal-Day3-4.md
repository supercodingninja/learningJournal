Code 201: Day 3

*****IT IS HIGHLY VITAL, TO BE EMPATHETIC TO THE END USER*****

***Learn that CODE REVIEW IS VITAL AND AWESOME***

"use strict" it will prevent you from using variables that are not declare (not a good idea to not to declare variables).  It is a best practice to utilize 'use strict';
      Not utilizing the 'use script'; declaration is an interview flag.

Never use " ... " in Javascript (JS): ALWAYS USE ' ... ' IN JS.

cmd functions Short-Cut Key/Concepts:

      1. place cursor on line, without highlighting; and you can press Control key + Command + and either the up or down arrow.
      2. you can select multiple lines; and do this.
      3. Comment/uncomment a large body of code, by Command key + /


***I need to be mindful of the Control Flow on my page***

Control is the way we manage how our JS is manage; and they way we operate how/when things are manage.  Flow charts can become very complicated; but DO NOT let become overcomplicated.

      ex. when you think of a box think of it as a single box, that can have multiple ways, that lead into a story line.

Allow your thinking about Control Flow to be very, simple and easy.
  **Side note: Switch Statements are used by beginner programmers- everything you can do with your switch statements can be told by and better with an if/else statement.**
    Types of Control Flow:

                            1. if/else
                            2. if {
                                  else if
                                  else if
                                  etc.
                                }
                            3. While Loop (DANGER OF INFINITE LOOPS)
                                  - a DO WHILE statement will always check the condition within the code block of a While Loop, once; and then, compare it to the function.
                            4. For Loop

***I need to learn how to effectively look up information: because NO ONE knows everything***
  - W3Schools (easier for new beginners able to look up, and understand: but not professional)
  - MND (ANSWERS MORE IN DEPTH, more dense, more professional)
  - StackOverFlow (Everybody always uses StackOverFlow; and it can be a good source, if used properly.  Always remember there are no answers on top, answers are rated ("up votes"); and make sure your question is not already answer.)

  **SIDE NOTE: It's better to be methodical and bright in your coding; rather than fast, with a lot of typos.  It's normal o be slow at at coding.  DON'T WORRY: you'll get faster he more you code, over time.**

***Reviewed: CSS book (pgs. 229-2)***

    **Side Note: keep pg. 238 in "HTML and CSS design and Build Websites," by Jon Ducket on the side: a good reference for selectors.**


Code 201: Day 4

CSS Layout
Do not under-estimated CSS Layout.  We can make in line text act like block; and we can make block elements act like block.

- Normal flow is what happen if you don't try to change anything.

- Relative will let you offset something from a normal row.

- Absolute just let's the user scrolls up and down the page.  Absolute positions itself to it's closest relative parent.

- Fixed positions

- Floating elements


JS Functions
The way we're going to use a function, is how we use a line of cold: so we don't have to write a whole line of code.
variables inside of the scope { } are called function scope (always declare your variables).

When declaring functions, think of the variable being the container you want to put something in.

 'use script' is a literal expression, used in JS apps 1.8.5+; which indicates that the code should be used in strict mode.
