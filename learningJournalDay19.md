Here's what I learned, thus far...

  The more simple you can keep your CSS, the better it is; and remember to Control Flow.**

***Week 4***
Code 201: Day 4 (DAY 19)
There's seems to be so, much tension; and a lot from things I forewarned about: crunching in too, much of the wrong content (at least we're trying, and together), and what really concerns me are the simple mistakes that should not occur:
  1. working off of the master, instead of making and switching to a new branch (simply can be avoided if they take the first step, before they code: git checkout -b newBranchNameWhateverThatIs).
  2. They are pushing to the [Master]...WHY?!  If everyone pushes to their own brach, our "Git Shows" will never happen; or at least occur less.

I royally feel like I'm not listen too; until something happens.  I also feel like the group is not telling me something; and that something can hurt me.  I don't have to be here, so it seems: Dr. Hamm already made his decision; but I would like to change it.  The group went with my logic approach, they like how I justified Aaron's situation idea, by coming up with Who's Outside, as an example (I was just trying to help my friend, whom seems tense as well).  I'm just trying to go with the flow, for now.  I hope to prove myself as a valuable team player; and coder...we'll see: something just does not seems right.
